# PersonalMangaDownloader
I need to download some images from a manga that I need to read offline. They are continuos like image1...image18.jpg, I kind busy to do it manually and I got a limited internet.


I wanted to download a manga ("japanese comics"), and it has this format:
url/chapter/chapterNumber.extension
So If I can guess the chapter number and the extension, instead of going in the browser and save it.
I just need to put the url there and it will download. Then I can read.

It helps me a lot since my internet is limited, and also I can get my skill updated


DISCLAIMER: This isn't somekind of piracy or manga download software.
